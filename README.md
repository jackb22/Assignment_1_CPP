C++ Assignment 1 Questions

1. Create a C++ program that will generate a multiplication table. 
   Start with the 1× table, followed by 2×, then 3×, and so on, until you have generated a table from 1× to 12×.

2. Write a program that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa.
   The program will accept a number (temperature) and a temperature unit designation (i.e., character F or C) from the user, and then convert the temperature into the other unit system. 
   The program will echo the input as part of the final conversion output. The temperature units should be printed in full (Fahrenheit or Celsius).
   Your program should use real numbers—not integers—for both input and output.

3. create a table of temperature conversions, starting from −40 degrees (both Fahrenheit and Celsius), and running at 5 degree intervals for 100 entries in each table.

4. Create an interactive help system for C++ programming. The system will incorporate a menu system that interacts with the user, and the appropriate help topic will be displayed, based on an input selection.

5. write a program that uses two nested for loops and the modulus operator (%) to detect and print all prime numbers from 1 to 10,000. Prime numbers are integral numbers that are only evenly divisible by themselves and one (1). Display all the prime numbers found.
